# FindHinnantDate
# ---------------
#
# This module finds Howard Hinnant's date and time library for C++11 and beyond
# See https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date for details.
#
# This will define the following variables::
#
#   HinnantDate_FOUND       - True if the system has the library
#   HinnantDate_INCLUDE_DIR - The directory which includes the header
#
# and the following imported targets::
#
#   HinnantDate::Date   - The target to use date.h
#
# The target will enable the required C++11 standard in your compiler. You can
# use any later standard but you have to enable them explicitly.
